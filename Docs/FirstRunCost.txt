WLED Cube Comparison:
Cheapest WLED LEDs alone @$0.0311/LED = $47.77
Classic WS2812 WLED LEDs alone @$0.0679 = $104.29



Reasons why WLED wasn't going to work:
The WLEDs are larger 5x5xmm for the cheap ones and 2.85x3.5mm for the classic WS2812s instead of the chosen 2.1x2.1mm of the common anode version
	-> That would mean the same size of panel could only fit a 8x8 grid rather than the 16x16
The WLEDs are software power limited so if there was an error we could end up drawing 12mA per LED so 18A...
	-> bruh battery go boom, not really the LDO would thermally regulate or the battery PCM would turn it off (the current design sets a hardlimit on the power draw to within operating conditions)
Using WLEDs is boring and ruins the message of being an ode to Multiplexing
